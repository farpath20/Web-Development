          <h1>The story of my day so far</h1>
            <main>
            <p>After waking up at 2pm I realized that I have not studied for my data base class. However, I still went on tik tok and stayed there until 3. I took a shower and it felt nice and I wanted to wear my brand new cardigan. Had to have my brother drive me to school and he told me he got acceptted for a job. Had a bagel for lunch and am going to a WISO event after class. </p> 
            <p>Next I saw Bryant and Chaitha and they were talking for a  bit and joking and paling around. Rayhan came in and then the rest of the guys left so it was me and him. Knowing me I am a real procrastinist and would not like to study or do this assignment so I was annoying Rayhan. I was like hey lets play connect..... he said no. I was like hey lets joke around he was focused on his work. However, I convince him to play connect four with me. And I lost :(. I also got a rematch and won like a boss I am.</p>
            <p>During the whole time me and Rayhan was hanging out there was a couple that was arguing. I'm talking about the guy is fighting for his life out here. For some reason I thought it was a good idea to play connect 4 music on the speakers and being silly. So I'm gonna hand this assignment in and hopefully study well for the upcoming data base mid term and not fail the exam. </p>
